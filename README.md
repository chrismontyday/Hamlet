# Hamlet
You are the Chieftain of a small Hamlet. You must instruct your town Elders as to was to do. 

Turn based sandbox strategy game. Every turn is a 'Gathering of the Elders' in which you must instruct them on what it is you want them to do. 
Or not! You can also just sit back and watch your tiny Hamlet grow on it's own. There is no wrong way to play Hamlet nor is there a specific 
point to the game.
